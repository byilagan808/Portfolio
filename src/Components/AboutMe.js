                        I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in information and computer sciences at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. 
                        I grew up in mililani, Hawaii.I developed an interest in coding after taking a handful of computer science 
                        classes in high school. Now I am highly motivated to learn and enhance my knowledge by taking on new tasks 
                        and learning new languages. My primary goal is to excel as a frontend or full-stack developer by putting my
                         technical talents and knowledge to use.
